## Abstract
ExoArm is a project whose goal is to construct a safe and functional prototype of a device that can help with humanâ€™s motion. This product is aimed to lift objects with the 12V motor by using a worm drive which consists of a worm and worm gear. The efficiency of the product is based on the driveâ€™s irreversible direction of rotation and its gearing ratio. In this project, the group put safety as the first priority since the device is used on the human body. Hence, tests, safeguarding methods, and alerting systems will make sure that ExoArm is safe. By minimizing risk and maximizing efficiency, the product aims to be useful, efficient, and economical.

## Introduction
### Problem Overview
In a developing world where technology has created convenience for humans, assisting in their best potential, there remains one simple daily task: lifting. It can range from picking up a cup of water that weighs 0.5 kg to carrying a 100 kg box. Our group created ExoArm to help people pick up heavy objects easily without requiring human power. It not only lifts but also holds heavy objects for extended periods. Targeted at a wide range of audiences, the ExoArm must be affordable.

### Project Objectives
Our goal is to create a safe and cost-efficient ExoArm using 12V motor. The maximum load can be adjusted by changing the gear ratio while ensuring user safety.
